# Semantic-Segmentation

Semantic Segmentation implementation in Tensorflow for autonomous vehicles

## Model training

To train the model, run ```python train.py``` for the whole 35 classes segmentation model or ```python train_8.py``` to train the 8 category version.

## Model testing

Once the model has been trained, run ```python test.py``` to see the results of new images for 35 classes segmentation or ```python test_8.py``` for the 8 categories version.
